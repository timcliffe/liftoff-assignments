## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app is essentially a system to automate the statistics management and core came mechanics for an online role-playing game I participate in, called Divide & Conquer VII. The idea came about as a way to solve a unique, real-world problem. The players of the game have, for a while now, been having a hard time keeping track of all their statistical information for their player country in the game. The development of this app aims to make that entire process easier and thus make the games easier to run and play overal.

### Features
Update Stats: 
This allows a user to update the statistics for their country. Once they're done filling out the information, they can click a button and the calculations will be done automatically and the information will be displayed on the main statistics page.

Order Production:
This takes the user to a page where they can order that week's military production.

Add New Units:
This feature allows the user to create new military units for them to be able to order in their production claims.

### Technologies
Java
SQL
phpMyAdmin
SQLAlchemy
HTML
Thymeleaf
MVC

### What I'll Have to Learn
There are certain key HTML elements I'll have to learn or re-learn. I'll also have to learn how to deal with the gaps of time it takes for certain military units to be produced. Is there a way to delay something for a certain amount of time? That's what I have to find out.
